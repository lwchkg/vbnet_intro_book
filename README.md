# Introduction to Visual Basic.

This project is a book called “Introduction to Visual Basic”, which is used in HKTA Tang Hin Memorial Secondary School.

## Disclaimer

As a school curriculum, I have to make a few tradeoffs to the content, such as

* Use `And` for `AndAlso` and `Or` for `OrElse`.
  This is done because teachers have a hard time transiting from VB6, and will feel very uncomfortable with new keywords.

* Limit integral data types to `Integer`.
  `Integer` should be sufficient for a beginning learner, unless the learner is good enough to master the material in a short time.
  This happens to be only for the best 0.1% of the students, and they can probably find out about the different types about my help.
  
* No `Decimal` data type.

## Copyright and Licensing

The books are created for HKTA Tang Hin Memorial Secondary School, so I have attached the message “Copyright HKTA Tang Hin Memorial Secondary School” in all PDF files.
However, the book is completely my creation, and I believe I still have the copyright because there is no copyright transfer happening in my employment contract.

I have not included an license for the books here.
If someone wants to use the book under a certain license, we can probably discuss.

Anyway, if you want to use the book personally, just feel free to use it (and give me comments too).
If you're a non-profit organization that use the book for education purposes, you can also feel free to use it.
But please drop me a email so we don't miss any oppotunities to collaborate.

However, if you want to use the book commercially (i.e. to make a profit), then we need to discuss about the terms.
