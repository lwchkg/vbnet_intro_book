When we perform some operations repeatedly, we group the operations together into procedures.
This avoids the problem of copying the same, or similar code, everywhere in your source.

In Visual Basic.NET, a procedure that returns a value is called a `Function`, and a procedure without a return value is called a `Sub`.

You have already encountered a few procedures before.
`Sub Main()`, `Console.WriteLine`, `Console.Write` and `Console.ReadLine` are all procedures.
