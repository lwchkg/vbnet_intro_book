== C++

+++C++ is one of the most popular programming language (much more popular
that Pascal). If you want to be a good programmer, C++ is a programming
language that you must learn.+++

+++C language, the predecessor of C++, is also widely used today.+++

== JavaScript

JavaScript is available in a web browser, allowing dynamic user interaction in a web site.
New web technologies, i.e. Ajax and HTML5 rely on JavaScript as the programming language.

There is also a framework called node.js that allows JavaScript code to be run outside browsers.


== PHP

PHP is one of the most popular programming languages for a web server.
With PHP you can dynamically generate web contents, and many other things, depending on user input.
PHP is used in http://www.tanghin.edu.hk.


== Visual Basic.NET

Visual Basic.NET is the programming language you are going to learn in this book.
Visual Basic is the easiest programming language to learn if you want to create a program in Graphical User Interface (GUI).
