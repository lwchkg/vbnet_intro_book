= {% autotitle %}{% endautotitle %}

In the last chapter, we have learnt to use If...Then...Else statement to make simple decisions.

To do this we need two conditions:

[.text-center]
`marks >= 0` and `marks \<= 100`.

And the *logical operator* `And` is needed to join the conditions together, i.e.

[source, vb]
If marks >= 0 And marks <= 100 Then
