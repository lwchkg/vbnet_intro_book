In Visual Basic, you use variables to store values.
Variables have a name and a data type.

==	Declaring variables with Dim statement
Before you use a variable, you should tell Visual Basic in advance, using the `Dim` statement:

....
Dim variablename [As type]
....

The data type of the variable can be one of the following:
[options="header", cols="1,4"]
|===
|Data type | Description
|Integer
|Integer (between -2,147,483,648 through 2,147,483,647)
|Single
|Single-precision floating point (about 7 significant figures).
|Double
|Double-precision floating point (about 16 significant figures).
|Boolean
|Either `True` or `False`
|String
|Text (holds your name, ID card number, etcâ€¦)
|===

See the following example for their use:

[source, vb]
....
Dim score As Integer
Dim weight As Double
Dim finished As Boolean
Dim name As String
....

Determine the correct data type(s) for the following data, and write down a Dim statement, where the name of the variable is the underlined word.
[options="header", cols="3,1,3"]
|===
|Description of data |Data type |Dim statement
|The [underlined]_height_ of a student (in cm). ||
|The [underlined]_marks_ of a test. ||
|The academic [underlined]_grade_ of a student. ||
|The [underlined]_age_ of your father. ||
|Whether you are [underlined]_wealthy_. ||

== Keywords and names of variables
Some words have special meanings in Visual Basic, such as `Dim`, `As`, `Integer`, `Double`, `Boolean`, and `String`.
These words are known as keywords, or reserved keywords.
The list of Visual Basic keywords in Visual Studio 2015 can be found in https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd409611(v=vs.140).aspx
The name of a variable cannot be any of the reserved keywords.

In addition, it must obey the following rules:

* It must begin with an alphabetic character or an underscore (`_`).
* It must only contain alphabetic characters, decimal digits, and underscores.
* It must contain at least one alphabetic character or decimal digit.

== Giving values to variables in the Dim statement

We can assign a value to a variable in the same `Dim` statement.
This is a good practice in programming because it eliminates potential mistakes.

[source, vb]
....
Dim score As Integer = 0
Dim weight As Double = 129.3
Dim finished As Boolean = False
Dim name As String = "Chan Tai Man"
....


== Declaring several variables in a single line
We can declare several variables in a single Dim statement.
However, if two or more variables are present in one `As` clause, we cannot assign values to these variables at the same time.

[source, vb]
....
Dim a, b, c As Single, x, y As Double, i As Integer
' a, b, and c are all Single; x and y are both Double
....


== Using variables to store values
We can assign a value to a variable with the equal sign (`=`).
Once a new value is stored in the variable, the old value is forgotten.
See the example below:

[source, vb]
....
Dim x, y As Integer
x = 5       ' x is set to 5
y = 3       ' y is set to 3
x = 2       ' x becomes 2, y is unchanged
y = x + 2   ' y becomes (x+2)=(2+2)=4, x is unchanged
x = y + 3   ' x becomes (y+3)=(4+3)=7, y is unchanged
....

=== Class work

With reference to the programs below, write down the values of the variables *after* the execution of each of the statements.

[options="header", cols="3a, ^1l, ^1l, ^1l"]
|===
|Program |Value of a |Value of b |Value of t
|[source, vb]
Dim t As Integer
| --- | --- | ---

|[source, vb]
Dim a As Integer = 2
|2 | --- | ---

|[source, vb]
Dim b As Integer = 6
|2 |6 | ---

|[source, vb]
t = a
|||

|[source, vb]
a = b
|||

|[source, vb]
b = t
|||
|===


[options="header", cols="2a, ^1l, ^1l"]
|===
|Program |Value of p |Value of q
|[source, vb]
Dim p As Double = 3
|| ---

|[source, vb]
Dim q As Double = 4.5
||

|[source, vb]
q = p - 0.5
||

|[source, vb]
p = 2
||

|[source, vb]
p = (p + q) / 2
||

|[source, vb]
q = (p - q) / 2
||
